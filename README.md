# PageBot® Examples

[github.com/PageBot/Examples](https://github.com/PageBot/Examples)

The aim of this project is to offer working PageBot examples, from basic documents to more complete ones.
These include explanations of PageBot usage principles, and a user manual and user documentation.

## What is PageBot®?

PageBot is a page layout program that enables designers to create high quality documents by programming.
It is available both as Python library, and as part of a collection of stand-alone desktop applications.
The primary context (and UI) for working with PageBot is **DrawBot** ([code](https://github.com/typemytype/drawbot) & [homepage](http://www.drawbot.com)), and other contexts such as **Flat** ([code](https://github.com/PageBot/Flat) & [homepage](http://xxyxyz.org/flat)) and even **InDesign** are also available.
These various contexts mean PageBot can output to print-ready formats, and to run in environments other than macOS, such as POSIX web servers, or [Google Cloud](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python).

A secondary aim of the PageBot developers is to create a system for making scriptable applications that generate professionally designed documents with high quality typography.

## What kinds of publications is PageBot® good for?

* Magazines
* Newspapers
* Books
* Newsletters and booklets
* Wayfindng signage systems and maps
* Corporate identities, including styleguides, business cards, stationary, etc
